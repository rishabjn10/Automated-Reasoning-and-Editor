Here's a simple yet effective **README.md** file for your project, outlining the purpose, setup instructions, and usage of the Docker and Docker Compose setup for running `crewai` flows.

### **README.md**  
# 🚀 CrewAI Flow Runner (Dockerized)

This project provides a Dockerized solution to run `crewai` workflows in a clean, isolated environment. The output is saved in a shared directory accessible outside the container, allowing for easy inspection of results.

## 🛠️ **Setup and Installation**  

### 1. **Prerequisites**  
- Docker installed (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- Docker Compose installed (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  
- Python (Optional for local testing, not required for Docker)

---

### 2. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishabjn10/Automated-Reasoning-and-Editor.git
cd Automated-Reasoning-and-Editor
```

---

### 3. **Install Dependencies (Optional, for local testing)**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🐳 **Docker Instructions**  

### **1. Build the Docker Image**  
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### **2. Run the Container**  
```bash
docker-compose up
```
- The `crewai flow kickoff` command will run automatically.
- Outputs will be saved in the `output/` directory on your local machine.

### **3. Stop the Container**  
```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 📤 **Output Directory**  
- The `output/` directory inside the container is linked to the same directory on your host machine.  
- After running the workflow, check the results:  
```bash
ls output/
```

---

## 🔄 **Rebuilding the Image (if needed)**  
If you update the code or dependencies, rebuild the image:  
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

---
## 🧹 **Cleaning Up**  
To remove all stopped containers and dangling images:  
```bash
docker system prune
```

---

## 📋 **Customization**  

### Modify `requirements.txt`  
Add any additional Python dependencies needed for your `crewai` workflow.

### Update `docker-compose.yml`  
Change the number of concurrent runners or adjust volume mappings.
